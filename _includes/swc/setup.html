## Data Download

Download the data from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder_data.csv

Save this file as: gapminder_data.csv

To download it directly into your Rstudio Environment: 

~~~
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder_data.csv", destfile = "data/gapminder_data.csv")
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

## Install R and RStudio
R and RStudio are two separate pieces of software:

R is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis
RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R easier. In this course we use RStudio to interact with R.
If you don’t already have R and RStudio installed, follow the instructions for your operating system below. You have to install R before you install RStudio.


## Update R and RStudio
If you already have R and RStudio installed, first check if your R version is up to date:

When you open RStudio your R version will be printed in the console on the bottom left. Alternatively, you can type sessionInfo() into the console. If your R version is 4.0.0 or later, you don’t need to update R for this lesson. If your version of R is older than that, download and install the latest version of R from the R project website for Windows, for MacOS, or for Linux
It is not necessary to remove old versions of R from your system, but if you wish to do so you can check How do I uninstall R?
Note: The changes introduced by new R versions are usually backwards-compatible. That is, your old code should still work after updating your R version. However, if breaking changes happen, it is useful to know that you can have multiple versions of R installed in parallel and that you can switch between them in RStudio by going to Tools > Global Options > General > Basic.
After installing a new version of R, you will have to reinstall all your packages with the new version. For Windows, there is a package called installr that can help you with upgrading your R version and migrate your package library.
To update RStudio to the latest version, open RStudio and click on Help > Check for Updates. If a new version is available follow the instruction on screen. By default, RStudio will also automatically notify you of new versions every once in a while.
